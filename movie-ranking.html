<h1>The Best Movies According To Joshua</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>American Gangster</h3>
<p> 
This is one of my favourite movies because it represented a real life story of a legendary person named Bumpy Johnson and his friend named Frank Lucas.<br />
Bumpy learned Frank Lucas the hard rules of the street and he did a good job of following him in his footsteps.<br />
Even though the movie took more than 2 hours, it was still nice to watch.<br />
</p>

<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>
Troy is definitely in my top 3 movies of all time.<br /> 
Its a movie I've seen more than 7 times and it never get bored to watch it all over again.<br />
I'll probably watch it again real soon.<br />
</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p> 
This is a weird, but a reallistic movie thats based on a true story.<br />
THey probably made it a bit more dramatic but it is still interesting to watch.<br />
